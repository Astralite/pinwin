# pinwin - stands for "Pin Windows"
I always liked DeskPins application, very simple and intuitive, [link for direct download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzOSyp06l5JwMVNXYkFMQXNMUTQ/view?usp=sharing) is provided here for your convenience (using Google Drive).

Unfortunately, it did not work well on Windows 8 and higher.
So I decided to write one in .NET with support for all OS (hopefully).

If someone likes my application as much, and one day we get in era of 3D non-windows interfaces, perhaps, they will rewrite this code to fit new OS, in a similar fashion I plan to do with DeskPins. The assumption is of course that .NET and C# will exist to that day.

This project is also a chance for me to learn GitHub, which today everybody is raving about. :)
My experience with version control systems was Visual Source Safe, then Subversion (TortoiseSVN + VisualSVN server + AnkhSVN), then TFS, and I'm really a fan of Subversion among those listed. We'll see how GitHub ranks in this competition after this project is completed.
