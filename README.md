# pinwin - stands for "Pin Windows"
I always liked DeskPins application, very simple and intuitive, it allows you to make any 3rd party window, i.e. that of another application, as top most (also known as "always-on-top"), and it will appear on top of other windows at all times, until DeskPins application is closed. Below is a screenshot of how it works, self-explanatory:

If you look at the attached readme file, the original software is not meant to work on Windows Vista and above. However, it kept working all the way until Windows 7, but then unfortunately, stopped working on Windows 8 and higher.
So I decided to write one in .NET with support for all OS (hopefully).

This project is also a chance for me to learn GitHub, which today everybody is raving about. :)
My experience with version control systems was Visual Source Safe, then Subversion (TortoiseSVN + VisualSVN server + AnkhSVN), then TFS, and I'm really a fan of Subversion among those listed. We'll see how GitHub ranks in this competition after this project is completed.
